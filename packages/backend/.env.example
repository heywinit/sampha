# --- CONVEX ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ---
# To set environment variables that are accessible within your Convex functions (e.g., process.env.MY_VAR):
#
# 1. Local Development:
#    Add them directly to your `.env.local` file in this directory.
#    Note: Some variables might need to be pushed to the Convex cloud if not running locally.
#
# 2. Production/Cloud:
#    Use the Convex CLI:
#    npx convex env set MY_VAR my_value
#
#    Or use the Convex Dashboard:
#    https://dashboard.convex.dev/project/your-project/settings/environment-variables
